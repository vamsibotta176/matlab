%this scrpit is usued to calculate the volume of the hollo cylinder
% for the hollow cylinder we need the inner and outer radius of the hollow
% cylinder
%ro user have to enter the  outer  radius of the hollow cylinder  
ro=input("please enter the outer  radius:")
%ri is the inner radius of the hollow cylinder

ri=input("please enter the inner radius:")
%the volume of the hollow cylinder 
vol=(4/3)*pi*(ro^3-ri^3)

% to calculat the atomic weigth of the hydrogen perioxide
% I n he hydrogen peroxidie will have 2 hydrgoen molecules and 2 oxygen
% molecules
% h will indicates the the atomic weigth of the hyde=rofgen molecule

h=input("please give the atomic number of the hydrogen:")
% o indicates the oxygen atomic weight 
o=input("please enter the atomic number of the oxygen:")
% total atomic weight of the hydrogen peroxide
total=2*h+2*o
length(total)

x=input("please enter the real number:")
fprintf("the real number is %3.4f\n",x)

fprintf("the number is %2.4f\n",10)
